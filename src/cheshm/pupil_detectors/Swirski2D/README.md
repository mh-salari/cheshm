# Swirski 2D — pupil detector

Pupil tracker for off-axis eye images. Haar surround feature localises
the pupil → k-means histogram segmentation → Canny edges → starburst
rays from three seed centres → RANSAC ellipse fit with image-aware
support.

## Origin & licence

The algorithm and the bulk of this source come from Lech Swirski's
**pupiltracker** library (2014). Licensed under the **MIT licence**;

## Pass-1 modernisation

The upstream C++ has been reorganised into cheshm's per-detector
"complex detector" layout (`include/Swirski2D/` + `src/`). Pass-1
modernisation per [REFACTOR.md](../../../REFACTOR.md):

  - Namespace `pupiltracker` → `cheshm::Swirski2D`.
  - Header guards → `#pragma once`.
  - Dropped the upstream `tracker_log` debug helper (with its
    `boost::lexical_cast` dependency) and the matching parameter
    on `findPupilEllipse`. Also dropped the `SECTION(name, log)`
    timing macro; the algorithm body is unchanged.
  - Replaced `BOOST_FOREACH` (7 sites) with C++11 range-for.
  - Replaced `boost::math::isnormal` with `std::isnormal`.
  - Replaced Intel TBB at all 3 parallel sites (Haar `parallel_reduce`,
    starburst `parallel_for` + `concurrent_vector`, RANSAC
    `parallel_reduce`) with vendored header-only
    [poolSTL](https://github.com/alugowski/poolSTL) (MIT, under
    `third_party/poolstl/`). `poolstl::par` is used as the execution
    policy with `std::transform_reduce` (Haar) and `std::for_each`
    (starburst, RANSAC). Apple Clang's libc++ ships without a parallel
    STL backend, so `std::execution::par_unseq` would silently fall
    back to sequential there — poolSTL fills that gap portably.
  - Dropped the unused `<opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>` and
    `<opencv2/core/core_c.h>` includes; replaced the deprecated
    `CV_AA` constant with `cv::LINE_AA`.

Pass 2 (deep modernisation — `std::span`, `std::optional`, drop raw
pointers / arrays, smart pointers) and Pass 3 (speed) are pending.
